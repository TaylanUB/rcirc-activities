rcirc-activities

Clean and minimal activity tracker, ready to be modified/extended.
Does a bit more than rcirc's built-in activity tracking, and won't
need delving into rcirc to modify/extend, since it's based on hooks.

The default front-end depends on ido!
Bind `rcirc-activities/switch-to-buffer' to a key of choice.
Implement an alternative front-end at will.
Just use the `rcirc-activities/activities' alist.

I'm moving to circe. This project was short-lived.
Sadly there appear to be bugs, I won't attempt to find them.
